## 📝Description

A Blockchain - based, integrated web model that monitors skill verification of sportsmen, Data management , smart contracts , stats and rankings for the cricket organisations. Implementing the most secure blockchain technology elucidates organisations to verify and track their teams and players records, manage funds and contracts.


1. The model is a gateway to the modern sports era tailored specifically for players, organisations and their fans offering a comprehensive set of features to elevate cricketing experience. We provide you a framework to engage in online vibrant
communities and showcase your spirits

2. The web application showcases initially through a homepage which provides a subtle introduction about the framework
accompanied by sign up and login pages for the players.

3. As a user i.e. the player will sign up through his credentials which will be accessible to the cricket organisation authorities and
stored.

4. The player then will be directed to a local routed server through imported directories which requires his personal details i.e. the
username, password (entered previously), his expertise as a batsmen or a bowler and finally his certificates. Then the user will
submit the form and the authenticity of the details will be verified through a verification system.

5. This will redirect the verification authorities specifically to the online verification system which can only be accessed by them
and not the user. The details and certificates will be verified digitally and skilled players will be selected for the team auctions.

6. A Ranking and Comparison page is enabled with public visibility to showcase the team rankings and player stats along with their
ratings and current performance.

7. This will reflect globally on the portal and enhance public interaction and auctions. The core authorities will thus analyse,
work and build their respective teams.

8. To invoke secure digital transactions and desirable funds transfer to a player’s account, smart contracts are implemented as a
feature. The server links to Metamask framework which will be connected to the contract and transaction amount, type of funds,
value , ID number etc will be displayed to the funding organisations through a pop-up notification.

9. Likewise, the project aims to glorify cricket globally through digital security and web enhancements and can be extended to any sports in the current sphere. A contest to emulsify the spirits of a riveting sport has been the primary aim of the idea and the implementation makes an easy access to connect and develop globally.
